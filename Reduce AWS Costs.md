# How to reduce Amazon AWS costs:  

As times passes, we might need to provide new infrastructure to new services,  
or the traffic changes or AWS releases new services, new regions, or instance types, etc.  
The point is that our infrastructure will change over time.  
And hence, `Cost optimization` needs to be done periodically to achieve the best results.  

**Step-1**:  
Try to get the monthly billing of each of the services that we use from AWS -  
**Step-2**:  
Choose the main services to focus -  
**Step-3**:  
Define the strategies for each service -   
  There are many different ways to improve costs  
    - Strategies to reduce Amazon EC2 Instances Cost  
    - Strategies to reduce Amazon EBS Costs  
    - Strategies to reduce Amazon RDS Costs  
    - Strategies to reduce Amazon S3 Costs  
**Step-4**:  
Optimize -  
We need to perform the actions based on the previous strategy.  
This step would be complex at times, as the workloads may have live traffic,   
and we may have limited amount of time to make changes w/o affecting the services.  
In this case, we should consider maintenance window, testin on dev env. etc.
**Step-5:**  
Repeat -  
We need to do the previous optimization activity for all the strategy outlined above in Step-3.  
Moreover, the infrastructure will keep changing over the time-period, and new services will appear,  
so, it's worth repeating the above steps time to time frequently.
